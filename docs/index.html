            <h2>Good evening, Mr Zeus.</h2> 
            <p>I am writing this letter to you for witnessing an ad on Kaibacorp.com becoming a teacher in the Duel Academy School. Since I myself have graduated from the same school and seeing how many people struggle with the basics of cards, I believe that it would be wise to put someone with a lot of experience to fit that role and would appreciate it if you considered my proposition.
            </p>
            <p>As I have stated previously, I have graduated from Duel Academy and have become quite the big name around the streets. I have gained a deep understanding of the school's culture and its unique way of teaching, which I believe I can make better. This experience, coupled with my ability to quickly learn and thrive in new situations, has prepared me to take on the responsibilities of being a teacher.
            </p>
            <p>I pride myself on being a quick thinker who can adapt to almost any situation I am being put on. Whether its adjusting lesson plans to meet students or finding a way to make the lesions more manageable, I can make it work and remain calm to find a proper solution. Additionally, my fast learning abilities ensure that I can learn each of the students' way of thinking and remove things that would make learning difficult for them.
            </p>
            <p>I am enthusiastic about the possibility to continue contributing to the success of Duel Academy and to work alongside such a dedicated team of teachers and students. I am confident that my skills and experience would make me an ideal candidate for this position, and I would be honored to bring my energy and commitment to the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>However, I will admit that sometimes I can take on too much responsibility, meaning it could be difficult to delegate tasks to other teachers as well as students. I have also found that in the past, that I have not maintained the best work-life balance due to how dedicated I am to my job. I have made an effort to have a healthier balance, but it is still somewhat lacking as well as learning to trust others more and understand the value of teamwork in achieving better outcomes. 
            </p>
            <p>Once again, thank you for reading and feel free to contact me via my mail or phone number at your best convenience. I understand that others will look for the job and would not hold a grudge against anyone if you have picked a better candidate. That is just what life is, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. 
            </p>
            <p>Sincerely, Yugi Moto</p>
